<p class="AboutCont">In ARAtronics Laboratory we dedicate to use the diversity of science (Physic, Chemistry, Modern Control theory, Robotics, Optics, Material Science, Structural Dynamics, Vibration, Sensing ... etc) to develop a feasible solutions for Mechatronics applications in research and industry. As one of the potential applications is the sensing in the Mechatronics systems. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of micro-optical sensors for temperature, force, pressure, wall shear stress as well as electric and magnetic fields. These, micro-optical sensing technology based on the whispering gallery mode (WGM) optical resonators; Developed novel optical measurement techniques using optical resonators such as rings, disks or spheres, with sizes ranging from several microns to several hundreds of microns. Due to their ultra-high sensitivity potential, micro-sphere optical resonators have also been proposed as molecular/biological sensors. The sensors are based on dielectric micro-beads that are excited by coupling light from optical fibers. The technology exploits the morphology-dependent shifts in resonant frequencies that are commonly referred to as the whispering gallery modes (WGM). These optical resonances can possess extremely large quality factors (up to Q~10^9) allowing for very high sensor resolutions. Further, since the typical bead deformations are in the order of a nano-meter, these sensors essentially have no moving parts. This photonic sensor concept can be extended to a system of distributed sensors providing spatial data resolved in time and space.
